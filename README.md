# OpenClassrooms-P12-Amigo

We've reached the final OpenClassrooms project, and it's time to showcase our skills by creating something cool.

In this project, we have the freedom to unleash our creativity while adhering to a few guidelines:

- The app must be non-profit.
- We are required to implement a CI/CD solution.
- A performance monitoring solution is necessary.

Introducing my app, Amigo!  
With Amigo, you can plan your travels by selecting a country and specifying the travel dates.

Customize your trip by adding a list of places you want to visit.  
Stay organized with a To-Do List feature, ensuring you don't forget anything important.  
Additionally, manage your expenses with the built-in money management functionality.  

Throughout this project, I've acquired valuable knowledge and skills.  
I successfully utilized Firebase, a robust data persistence solution.  
Firebase Authentication was implemented for secure access control, while Firestore served as the database to store essential data.  
To monitor performance, I incorporated Firebase Analytics.  
I used GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

This project serves as a beautiful conclusion to the OpenClassrooms program, leaving me even more motivated to continue my journey and become an exceptional developer.  
Stay tuned for my future endeavors, as I strive to enhance my skills and present even more impressive projects. 

Thank you for your support!
